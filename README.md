This is an example repository to help reproduce a recent bug in GitHub Actions.

Bug report: https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/2550

When one creates a new project based on a template repository that contains a workflow that listens for the `push` event, the workflow runs twice.

Go ahead and try it out â€” hit the "Use this template" button and create a new repository based on this template.
Then navigate to the Actions tab, and you'll see that the workflow runs twice. ðŸ¤·
